You can install the Quarto JupyterLab extension one of two ways:

1.  Using `pip`, you can install the `jupyterlab-quarto` by executing:

    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | Platform       | Commands                                      |
    +================+===============================================+
    | Mac/Linux      | ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}               |
    |                | python3 -m pip install jupyterlab-quarto      |
    |                | ```                                           |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | Windows        | ``` {.powershell filename="Terminal"}         |
    |                | py -m pip install jupyterlab-quarto           |
    |                | ```                                           |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+

    This is the preferred way to install the JupyterLab Quarto extension as this takes advantage of traditional python packaging and doesn't require a rebuild of JupyterLab to complete the installation.

2.  In the JupyterLab UI, you can install the Quarto extension directly using the Extension Manager by searching for 'Quarto' and installing the `@quarto/jupyterlab-quarto` extension. To complete the installation you need to rebuild JupyterLab (you should see a prompt to complete this once you've installed the Quarto extension).
