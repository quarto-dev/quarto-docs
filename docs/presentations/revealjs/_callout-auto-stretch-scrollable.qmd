## Limitation: Auto-stretch and Scrollable 

When a slide is [scrollable](index.qmd#content-overflow) the image size calculations used by [auto-stretch](advanced.qmd#stretch) may not work well and images may not appear. Two solutions depending on your needs are:

- Disable auto-stretch at the presentation level, `auto-stretch: false`, and use `.r-stretch` on individual images only where needed.

- On slides that are scrollable, add the `.nostretch` class to disable auto-stretch on the slide.
