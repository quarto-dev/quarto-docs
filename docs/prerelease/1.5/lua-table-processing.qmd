title: Additional support for table processing control
---

In order for documents to render cleanly without warnings, Quarto 1.5 allows
users and library authors to specify on their HTML output that the entire output should
not be processed. 

In Quarto 1.4, this was possible to do on the table elements themselves. 
Quarto 1.5 allows you to declare the comment `<!--| quarto-html-table-processing: none -->` anywhere in an HTML RawBlock. When that comment is detected, Quarto will not
attempt to process the entire output element.

This enables output that would otherwise cause Quarto emit a warning to produce clean rendering, providing a better experience for library users especially.
