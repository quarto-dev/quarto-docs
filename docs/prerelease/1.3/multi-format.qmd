## Overview

Starting in Quarto 1.3, HTML pages (either standalone or in a website) automatically include links to other formats specified in the document front matter. For example, the following document front matter:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
```

Results in an HTML page that includes a link to the additional notebook format in the right margin below the TOC:

![](images/other-format.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of a HTML page that includes a link to the Jupyter format below the table of contents under the heading Other Formats."}

If a table of contents is enabled for the page, the additional formats will be automatically placed within the table of contents as a new section. If no table of contents is displayed, the additional formats will be displayed in the right margin at the top of the document.

Links to additional formats are displayed by default, but you can control whether they are shown or even which specific formats are included with the `format-links` YAML option.

## Rendering All Formats in Standalone HTML Documents

The Render buttons in RStudio and VS Code will not automatically render all formats if the document isn't part of a Quarto website. To render all formats use `quarto render` on the command line:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render multi-format.qmd
```

## Specifying Formats to Link

You can provide an explicit list of formats to include in the **Other Formats** section by providing a list as the value for `format-links`. For example, this document front matter will result in only the link to the Jupyter notebook format, excluding the PDF format:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
  pdf: default
format-links: [ipynb]
```

## Hiding All Links

To prevent format links from being shown at all, specify `format-links: false` in your document front matter. For example this front matter will not display the **Other Formats** links:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
format-links: false
```

## Controlling Formats at a Project Level

In a Quarto Project, to control the formats and their behavior for a specific folder, provide the `format`{spellcheck="false"} and `format-links`{spellcheck="false"} options in a `_metadata.yml`{spellcheck="false"} file. Similarly, you can specify these options for an entire project by including them in the `_quarto.yml` project file. See [Directory Metadata](/docs/projects/quarto-projects.qmd#directory-metadata) or [Project Metadata](docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#project-metadata) for additional details.
