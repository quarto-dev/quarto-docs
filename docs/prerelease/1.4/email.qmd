## Overview

Quarto v1.4 adds an email generation feature that can be used for HTML documents published in [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/). This feature extends the HTML output format and enables users to generate HTML and/or text emails that can be selectively delivered when the document is rendered in Connect.
