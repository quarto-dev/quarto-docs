{{< include _pre-release-feature.qmd >}}

Quarto v1.4 includes the following new features for Lua filters:

## Relative paths in `require()` calls

In larger, more complex filters, it becomes useful to structure your Lua code in modules.
Quarto v1.4 supports the use of relative paths in `require()` calls so that small modules
can be easily created and reused.

For example:

```{.lua filename="filter.lua"}
local utility = require('./utils')
function Pandoc(doc)
  -- process 
end
```

Using relative paths this way in quarto makes it harder for multiple filters to accidentally
create conflicting module names (as would eventually happen when using the standard Lua
`require('utils')` syntax). It's possible to refer to subdirectories and parent directories as well:

```{.lua filename="filter2.lua"}
local parsing = require('./utils/parsing')
function Pandoc(doc)
  -- process 
end
```

```{.lua filename="utils/parsing.lua"}
local utils = require("../utils")
-- ...
```
