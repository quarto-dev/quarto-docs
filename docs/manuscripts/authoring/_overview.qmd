On this page, we'll show you how to author an academic manuscript with Quarto in {{< meta tool.name >}}. You'll learn how to:

-   Preview your manuscript using the Quarto command line tool.

-   Add scholarly front matter to describe your article.

-   Add things like figures, tables, cross references and citations with Quarto specific markdown.

-   Include output from computations using inline code, or embedded from external notebooks.

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
The commands and syntax you'll learn will apply to any tool you might use to edit notebooks, not just Jupyter Lab. And, although we'll use Python code examples, Quarto works with any kernel, so you could use R or Julia instead.

The syntax you'll learn will apply regardless of the tool you are using to edit notebooks. And although we'll use R code examples, you could use Python or Julia instead.

## Do you mostly use `.ipynb`?

As a VS Code user, we recommend writing your article in a `.qmd` file. However, if you currently use VS Code primarily to work with `.ipynb` files, you may find the Jupyter Lab tutorial more applicable. Install the [Quarto extension for Jupyter Lab](#install-the-quarto-vs-code-extension), then pick up the Jupyter Lab tutorial at [Clone the Template Repository](jupyterlab.qmd#clone-repo). You might also like read about using [Quarto with VS Code's Notebook Editor](/docs/tools/vscode-notebook.html).

### Is this tutorial for me?

We will assume you:

-   are comfortable using {{< meta tool.name >}} to open and edit files,
-   have a GitHub account, and are comfortable cloning a repo to your computer,
-   are comfortable navigating your file system, and executing commands in a Terminal.
