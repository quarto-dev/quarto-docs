## Using Templates

If you want to customize the appearance of MS Word output, Pandoc supports a special type of template called a *reference document*. Here's an example of specifying a custom reference document for `docx`:

``` yaml
format:
  docx:
    reference-doc: custom-reference-doc.docx
```

Reference documents include sample text that uses all of the output styles used by Pandoc.

To use a reference doc template, just copy it to your document's directory and reference it as shown above.

## Creating Templates {#sec-docx-create-template}

To create a new reference doc based on the Pandoc default, execute the following command:

    $ quarto pandoc -o custom-reference-doc.docx \
       --print-default-data-file reference.docx

Then, open `custom-reference-doc.docx` in MS Word and modify styles as you wish:

![You can open the Styles pane from the HOME tab in the MS Word toolbar.](images/word-styles.png){.preview-image fig-alt="Screenshot of Microsoft Word document open with Styles pane open in a pane over the left side of the document."}

When you move the cursor to a specific element in the document, an item in the styles list will be highlighted. If you want to modify the style of any type of element, you can click the drop-down menu on the highlighted item, and you will see a dialog box like this:

![](images/word-modify-styles.png){fig-alt="Modify Style dialog box with a properties section for selecting what is to be styled, and a formatting section for selecting the style settings. The color selection dropdown in the formatting section is open."}

After you finish modifying the styles, you can save the document and use it as the template for future Word documents.

## Applying Custom Styles

Pandoc provides default styles for elements like paragraphs or code blocks and default formatting for inline elements like bold. Custom styles can be defined using divs for blocks and spans for text, so a specific style is used instead of the default. 

Set the `custom-style` attribute with the name of the style defined in the default or user-provided reference document. 

For example, this applies a text style called `Emphasis` to the `Get out` text instead of the default style for text.

```markdown
[Get out]{custom-style="Emphasis"}, he said.
```

This will apply the paragraph style called `Poetry` to the content inside the Divs syntax `:::`

```markdown
Dickinson starts the poem simply:

::: {custom-style="Poetry"}
| A Bird came down the Walk---
| He did not know I saw---
:::
```

If the reference.docx file does not already contain the styles, they will be added to the output file with standard text as their base style. In case the styles are already defined, their definition will not be modified.

A possible workflow would be 

- Create a document using `custom-style` you need,
- Render this document so that they are created,
- Save this document as a reference document for further rendering

This ensures that the names of the styles used in `custom-style` match the names of the styles defined in the reference document.

Overall, this mechanism allows for great customization as it also works with a new style that would be defined in the reference doc. For advanced users, this could be coupled with [filters](../extensions/filters.qmd) to apply `custom-style` attribute to a filtered set of element in the document.
