## Quarto Websites 1: Build your homepage 

In this video, you’ll get a running start by using a template we've designed to be functional and attractive, and that will serve as a foundation for the rest of the video series. You’ll customize the content of your homepage, and how it looks, and along the way learn about the two key files in a Quarto website index.qmd and _quarto.yml. Finally, you’ll learn one way to publish your website so other people can see it.
