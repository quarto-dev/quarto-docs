Quarto 1.6 has been officially released! You can get the current release from the [download page](/docs/download/index.qmd)

## Crossrefs

It should now be easier to get Quarto to recognize subfloats (subtables, subfigures, etc) when they're emitted by code cells.
If the `subcap` attribute of a code cell has as many entries as the number of outputs from your code cell, Quarto knows to accept those as subfloats. 
See [#10328](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10328) for details.

Minimal example:

````
```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-example
#| tbl-cap: I want these images to be interpreted as Tables.
#| tbl-subcap:
#|   - This is the subcaption for the first subtable
#|   - This is the subcaption for the second subtable
plot(1:10)
plot(11:20)
```
````
