In today's Quarto Tip, we show you how [Positron](https://positron.posit.co)
enables a very easy workflow for creating and changing colors in your `_brand.yml`
file. Quarto 1.6 includes [support for `_brand.yml`](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/), a
standard for creating a single style configuration file that is usable across formats and
systems.

TODO: Add correct YouTube link once we have it.
