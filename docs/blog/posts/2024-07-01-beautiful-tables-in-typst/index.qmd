Quarto now allows HTML Tables with CSS styling to be output in Typst.

It does this by translating CSS properties into Typst properties. You can read about the feature [in the Guide](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#typst-css).[technical details [in the Advanced Docs](/docs/advanced/typst/typst-css.qmd)]{.aside}

Today let's see a few beautiful, expressive HTML tables that also look great in Typst! In all examples, the snapshot on the left is Typst, and the HTML version is on the right.

Here is a confusion matrix drawn with Pandas in Python. 

:::: {.column-body-outset}
::: {layout-ncol=2}

```{=html}
<iframe class="html-demo" src="demo/pandas-confusion-matrix.html" width=481 height=171></iframe>

Here is a nice use of cell background colors to draw a heatmap on a table of the familiar cars dataset.

:::: {.column-body-outset}
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](images/gt-cars.png)

::: {}
```{=html}
<iframe class="html-demo" src="demo/gt-cars.html" width=488 height=342></iframe>
```

Borders can help with organization of tables that have more structure than just rows and columns. Here's an example of populations grouped by subregion, using Great Tables.

Typst CSS misses one border here, because Great Tables is doing something extra-fancy. But it still looks pretty good!

:::: {.column-page}
::: {layout-ncol=2}

```{=html}
<iframe class="html-demo" src="demo/great-tables-oceania.html" width=800 height=1000></iframe>
```

And here's a simple island area table from gt.


:::: {.column-body-outset}
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](images/gt-islands.png)

::: {}
```{=html}
<iframe class="html-demo" src="demo/gt-islands.html" width=400 height=600></iframe>
```
