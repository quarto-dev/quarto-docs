Have been hearing about Quarto but didn't give it a try yet? Perused the [Get Started](docs/get-started/) pages but would like another intro? Or have about 20 minutes to spare and want to pick up a few Quarto tips? You've come to the right place!

**TO DO: Update video link below!**

{{< video "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc" >}}

In this video, I walk you through creating documents, presentations, and webpages and publishing with Quarto. The video features authoring Quarto documents using the [RStudio Visual Editor](docs/visual-editor/) and with executable code chunks in R.

Select highlights include:

-   Inserting cross references to tables and figures
-   Adding a citation from a DOI
-   Seamlessly switching between output formats as well as multi-format documents
-   Customizing code output location in presentations
-   Creating a webpage from scratch
-   Publishing the webpage to QuartoPub

If you would like to follow along as you watch the video, you can find the source code for everything created in the video in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/get-started-quarto) and the published [webpage on QuartoPub](https://mine.quarto.pub/welcome-to-quarto/).
