[Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) is a new open-source markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst creates beautiful PDF output with blazing fast render times.

See the Typst format [user guide](../../output-formats/typst.qmd) for more details on creating Typst output with Quarto.
