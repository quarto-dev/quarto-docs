As an example, consider the following `_brand.yml` file:

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
color:
  palette:
    dark-grey: "#222222"
    blue: "#ddeaf1"
  background: blue
  foreground: dark-grey
  primary: black

logo: 
  medium: logo.png

typography:
  fonts:
    - family: Jura
      source: google
  base: Jura
  headings: Jura
```

When this `_brand.yml` is placed in a project, webpages, presentations, PDF reports, and dashboards will share a common appearance:

::::::: {.column-body-outset-right layout-ncol="4"}
::: {}
![Webpage: `html`](/docs/authoring/images/brand-html.png){.lightbox group="brand-formats" fig-alt="Screenshot of a webpage. The text is dark grey on a light blue background, using a rounded sans-serif typeface, a logo appears in the navbar."}
:::

::: {}
![Dashboard `dashboard`](/docs/authoring/images/brand-dashboard.png){.lightbox group="brand-formats" fig-alt="Screenshot of a dashboard. The text is dark grey on a light blue background, using a rounded sans-serif typeface, a logo appears in the navbar."}
:::

::: {}
![Presentation: `revealjs`](/docs/authoring/images/brand-revealjs.png){.lightbox group="brand-formats" fig-alt="Screenshot of a presentation. The text is dark grey on a light blue background, using a rounded sans-serif typeface, a logo appears in bottom left of the slide."}
:::

:::{}
![PDF: `typst`](/docs/authoring/images/brand-typst.png){.lightbox group="brand-formats" fig-alt="Screenshot of a PDF document. The text is dark grey on a light blue background, using a rounded sans-serif typeface, a logo appears in top right of the page."}
