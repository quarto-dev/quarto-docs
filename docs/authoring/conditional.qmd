title: "Conditional Content"
---

In some cases you may want to create content that only displays for a given output format (or only displays when *not* rendering to a format). You can accomplish this by creating divs, spans and code blocks with the `.content-visible` and `.content-hidden` classes.

## .content-visible

To make content visible only for a given format, you can create a div (`:::`) with the `.content-visible` class. For example, here we mark content as only visible in HTML:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

Will only appear in HTML.

:::
```

You can also set conditions on non-executable code blocks:

```` markdown
```{.python .content-visible when-format="html"}
# code shown only in HTML
2+2
```
````

To apply a condition only to a part of a paragraph, use a span (`[]{}`):

``` markdown
Some text
[in HTML.]{.content-visible when-format="html"}
[in PDF.]{.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```

You can also mark content as visible for all formats *except* a specified format. For example:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}

Will not appear in PDF.

:::
```

Then `when-format` and `unless-format` attributes match the current Pandoc output format with some additional intelligence to alias related formats (e.g. html, html4, and html5). Details are provided below in [Format Matching](#format-matching)

`when-format` and `unless-format` can also be combined to create more complex conditions:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible when-format="html" unless-format="revealjs"}

Will only appear in HTML and not in Reveal.js, but actually it appears.

:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

Will only appear in Reveal.js and not in HTML or other formats.

:::
```

## .content-hidden

To prevent content from being displayed when rendering to a given format, use the `.content-hidden` class. For example, here we mark content as hidden in HTML:

``` markdown
::: {.content-hidden when-format="html"}

Will not appear in HTML.

:::
```

You can also mark content as hidden for all formats *except* a specified format. For example:

``` markdown
::: {.content-hidden unless-format="pdf"}

Will only appear in PDF.

:::
```

## Format Matching {#format-matching}

Then `when-format` and `unless-format` clauses do some aliasing of related formats to make it more straightforward to target content. The following aliases are implemented:
