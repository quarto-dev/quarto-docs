To create a cross-references to a diagram using div syntax, treat it like a figure. For example, @fig-simple is created using:

````markdown
::: {#fig-simple}

```{dot}
graph {
  A -- B
}
```

This is a simple graphviz graph
:::
````

::: {#fig-simple .column-margin}

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 1.5
graph {
  A -- B
}
```

This is a simple graphviz graph

If you would rather give diagrams a label and counter distinct from figures, consider defining [Custom Cross-Reference Types](cross-references-custom.qmd).
