# About our workflows

This repository uses different workflows to automatically updates the published websites

- <https://quarto.org/> - The documentation for Quarto, published from the `main` branch
- <https://prerelease.quarto.org/> - The documentation for Quarto prerelease, published from the `prerelease` branch

It also configures some website preview for pull requests, which are published to Netlify as deploy previews. The use non-production deploy and can be consulted to `deploy-preview-<PR number>.quarto.org`. 

Note that technically, <prerelease.quarto.org> is also a deploy preview on Netlify (non-production website) but with a fixed URL.

## Workflow files: What they do

- `publish.yml` - The workflow that publishes the documentation from `main` and `prerelease` branches to netlify. 
  - For stable release version, the doc is deployed from `main`, and published using `quarto publish netlify` command to production website on Netlify.
  - For prerelease version, the doc is deployed from `prerelease`, and published using Github Action `nwtgck/actions-netlify` which use Netlify API to deploy to a non-production website on Netlify.

- `preview.yml` - The workflow that creates a deploy preview for pull requests. It uses the same action `nwtgck/actions-netlify` to deploy to a non-production website on Netlify. The URL is `deploy-preview-<PR number>.quarto.org`.
  - PR previews are configured for any PR to `main` or`prerelease` branches.
  - They are automically created and updated when the PR is created and updated by a user with Contributor role. 
  - For external PR, the preview can be trigger by adding a comment `/deploy-preview` on the PR.

- `update-downloads.yml` - This workflow is triggered by a cron schedule. It retrieves information about latest release and prerelease on `quarto-dev/quarto-cli` repository and updates the download links on the website.
  - If there is a new version detected, it will commit the modified files and trigger a deploy of the website calling `publish.yml` workflow with `workflow_call` event trigger.
  - This applies to both `main` and `prerelease` branches
    - For `main` branch, we use `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action` to detect changes and commit them to the `main` branch
    - For `prerelease` branch, we use `git cherry-pick` the commit from main following previous above step. 
    - Then we trigger the `publish.yml` workflow with `workflow_call` event trigger for each of the branch.

- `upload-index.yml` - This workflow is triggered by a cron schedule. It updates the indexes for Algolia search engine, which powers the sites search. 
  - `search.json` is built when the website is rendered and then it is deployed to the website.
  - This index file is retrieved on deployed website to be updated on Algolia.
  - Both `quarto.org` and `prerelease.quarto.org` indexes are updated in the same run - they each use one specific algolia index

## Netlify Configurations

- This repo has a `_redirects` file in the root directory. Otherwise, configuration are made in NETLIFY UI. Quarto website is inside Posit Netlify account. 
- Automatic builds are turned off for this repo on Netlify because we currently need to render with Quarto CLI in Gihub Action CI before publishing the results. 
  - API deploy is used currently, using npm netlify package through `nwtgck/actions-netlify` github actions. One think to know: Netlify has removed `deploy()` function from its npm package in version 7 and recommends now to use Netlify CLI instead. But we are still using the package for now in CI, but also for `quarto publish netlify`.
  - Deploy previews are possible with manual deploy using an alias configuration for the deploy command; This allows us to `deploy-preview-<PR number>` and `prerelease` alias to be used for the deploy previews. 
  - This means our netlify website don't use automatic builds and automatic Branch deploy - Only deploy previews. 
  - The website uses [Automatic Deploy Subdomains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/automatic-deploy-subdomains/#use-a-new-custom-domain-for-your-automatic-deploy-subdomain) to have `prerelease.quarto.org` or `deploy-preview-<PR number>.quarto.org` working.

## Custom Domain

- `quarto.org` is registered in external registrar, but associated with Netlify DNS allowing use to use [custom domains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/multiple-domains/).
